# X App Clone

This is a project for developing a clone application of X formerly Twitter, although the end result may not be entirely identical to the X application. However, this application still provides a similar experience to X, where users can create accounts, log in, create tweets, interact with other users' tweets, and also create communities.

Please note that in using the third-party authentication solution Clerk that I am using, there is a limitation on the maximum number of members that can be in a community, which is only three members.
